/*
This is set 3 Question 1. Write a C program which is used to keep track of the
number of people passing a turn style at the local stadium. The program should
have four functions, one which is called when a person enters the stadium and
one which is called when a person leaves the stadium.  It costs â‚¬20 for a ticket
to the concert so a function should keep a track of total amount of money that
has been taken and print that to the screen. The final function should report
the current number of people at the concert.
