/*
This is set 5 Question 3. Write a C Program that asks users to rate the
performance of political parties by rating the partyâ€™s performance out of ten.
After asking for the rating, the program should ask the questions again for the
next user and so on. After the last user has indicated that there are no more
users, the program should summarise the results, showing which political party
had the highest and lowest rating.
